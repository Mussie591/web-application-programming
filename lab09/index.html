            <h2>Lab 9 Class</h2>
            This is a quiz system which allows students to take quizzes, get each student's quiz score and
            compute average score of students.
            Use constructor functions or class syntax to implement Student, Question and Quiz.

            <strong>constructor function/class Student:</strong>
            properties:
            studentId: a unique student id. it is number type.
            answers: holds an array that records the student's answers for the questions.
            method:
            addAnswer(question) - add student's question(id, answer) to answers array.
            <hr>
            <strong>constructor function/class Question:</strong>
            properties:
            qid: unique quesiton id. it is number type.
            answer: hold quiz correct answer or student's answer. It is string type.
            method:
            checkAnswer(answer) - used to check if student's answer is correct. It receives string value
            which is answer and returns boolean value.
            <hr>
            <strong>constructor function/class Quiz:</strong>
            properties:
            questions: It's a Map which holds question id and correct answers. The key is question id, the
            value is the correct answer for this question. You need to convert the given array to the map
            data structure in the constructor function.
            students: an array holds all students.
            methods:
            • scoreStudentBySid(sid), computes the quiz score for this student
            • getAverageScore(), computes the average score over all students
